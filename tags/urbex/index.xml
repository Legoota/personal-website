      <description>Abandonned convent A small convent in the alsacian wineyards. Besides a cat that scared us at the end, it was a very calm and relaxing visit. Lots of small empty rooms, a chapel, kitchen, interior garden.
Last picture was to finish the roll: we stumbled across some hang-gliders flying.
Photo details Second part of my BGC PHC-50 film roll. I think the blacks are really deep, and the 50 ISO + use of flash really made these look dramatic.</description>

The place is quite well known from exploration enjoyers, hence some artists beautifully decorated some of the rooms.
The first picture shows a graffiti of a masked man The second picture depicts a fully decorated room with music scores, pins, and typewritten letters.</description>
