      <description>Helsinki 1 First series of pictures from my Helsinki trip. I tried to capture there the city&amp;rsquo;s architecture. There are some notable buildings:
Second picture is the exterior of the Amos Rex museum Fourth picture is the Kansallismuseo Fifth picture is the front of the Helsingin tuomiokirkko, the city&amp;rsquo;s Cathedral. Photo details This trip was the first time I used the Rollei 35S, which was perfectly adapted to travel due to its pocket form factor.</description>

      <description>Helsinki 2 Second series of pictures from my Helsinki trip. This time, it is consacred to the University&amp;rsquo;s Botanical garden (Kaisaniemen kasvitieteellinen puutarha).
Photo details For these pictures, I had to play with the focus ring on the Rollei 35S, to get the focus on objects not in the infinite range. It is a bit imprecise, but some pictures turned out great.
Rollei 35S + Kodak Tri-X 400.</description>

      <description>Helsinki 3 Last series of pictures from my Helsinki trip. Some other great pieces of architecture:
Second picture is the Finnish Parliament (Eduskusta) Third picture depicts the Vesikko submarine, it was taken on the island of Suomenlinna Photo details I had to edit the plane wing picture to remove some stains and noises, which I normally don&amp;rsquo;t do because they are part of the picture when doing film photography. But since they were quite large, I had to work around to make it viewable.</description>
