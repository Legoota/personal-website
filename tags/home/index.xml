      <description>Abandonned convent A small convent in the alsacian wineyards. Besides a cat that scared us at the end, it was a very calm and relaxing visit. Lots of small empty rooms, a chapel, kitchen, interior garden.
Last picture was to finish the roll: we stumbled across some hang-gliders flying.
Photo details Second part of my BGC PHC-50 film roll. I think the blacks are really deep, and the 50 ISO + use of flash really made these look dramatic.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 10 This last set from the Alpinaraid series regroup all pictures I took during our trip to come back home. We drove by the Gorges du Verdon, which is where I took the different pictures.
It is a beautiful, natural place, that was unfortunately a bit dry when we were there.

      <description>Alpinaraid 9 Finish line! The first image was taken at the Menton Beach, where we finished the Alpinaraid. It was an amazing experience, I saw places, sceneries and landscapes that I have never seen before.
Second picture was taken during our trip along the Côte d&amp;rsquo;Azur.
Photo details Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra
The scenery from the first picture was so colorful, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with how the result turned out.</description>

      <description>Abandonned hotel in the mountains First part of the &amp;lsquo;abandonned hotel in the moutain&amp;rsquo; series: a hotel on top of the mountains, built in the 1920s and closed since 1994.
Inside: a pool, dancefloor, kitchen, rooms, and more. There is a second building which unfortunately burnt down (last picture).
Photo details First part of my BGC PHC-50 film roll. The Yashica ZoomTec 90 did a great job getting shots of this piece of history atop of the mountains.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 7 The first image was taken at the Caserme Della Bandia. It was very interesting to explore these ruins perched so high in the mountains.
Second and third pictures were shot during our visit of the Vallée de Névache: one of the most beautiful valley we took during this journey.

      <description>Helsinki 2 Second series of pictures from our Helsinki trip. This time, it is consacred to the University&amp;rsquo;s Botanical garden (Kaisaniemen kasvitieteellinen puutarha).
Photo details For these pictures, I had to play with the focus ring on the Rollei 35S, to get the focus on objects not in the infinite range. It is a bit imprecise, but some pictures turned out great.
Rollei 35S + Kodak Tri-X 400.</description>

      <description>Charon&amp;rsquo;s Charge Al Bumen Al Bumen sculpt is a collaboration between Nightcaps and Primecaps.
Charon&amp;rsquo;s Charge colorway was released during a Halloween sale, it is, I think, my favourite from this very detailed sculpt.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 6 The two pictures from this set are also among my favourites. They were taken at the Colle di Sommeiller, at 3000 m altitude. We were enjoying the landscape after going uphill about 800 m of positive elevation. Notice how the hood is a bit open: we called it the &amp;lsquo;race mode&amp;rsquo;, the goal was to cool-off the engine bay a bit faster.

      <description>Blackjack Reaper v1 Reaper v1 is my all time favourite sculpt. It was made by Brocaps.
Here, in my favourite colorway, Blackjack (black hood has some glitter dust, and eyes are red foiled).
Fun fact: I had the chance to acquire this cap as my first Reaper (now I own around 30 of them). I traded it two years later. Missed it instantly, so I tried hard to get it back.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 5 The first picture in this set is my favourite from the whole journey. I was lucky enough to take out the camera before the cloud could go further away, and managed to shoot it with the sunset hitting the grass in the foreground. It was taken at the Rifugio dell&amp;rsquo;Assietta.
The second and third images were probably taken during cool-off breaks for the car, after long uphill roads (as seen in the background of image #3).</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 3 In this set, I decided to show various landscapes taken during the journey.
The first image is one of my favourite from the two rolls I shot during the adventure. It was 5 minutes before we ended surronded by the clouds seen in the background, at the Colle delle Finestre (2176 m).
Second image was taken during an uphill in an old italian military track.
Third one was shot in the morning at Camping Le Gravelotte, just after our first camp night.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 1 This is it. After months of preparation of our Peugeot 205, we finally started our journey into the French and Italian Alps.
In this 10 set series, you can find the film photographies that I took during the whole adventure.
In this first set Alpinaraid 1, photos 1 and 2 were taken on the border of the Annecy Lake, in the early morning, on our way to the starting point at Col de la Madeleine (2000 m).</description>
