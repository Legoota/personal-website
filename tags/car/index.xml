      <description>Alpinaraid 10 This last set from the Alpinaraid series regroup all pictures I took during our trip to come back home. We drove by the Gorges du Verdon, which is where I took the different pictures.
It is a beautiful, natural place, that was unfortunately a bit dry when we were there.

      <description>Alpinaraid 9 Finish line! The first image was taken at the Menton Beach, where we finished the Alpinaraid. It was an amazing experience, I saw places, sceneries and landscapes that I have never seen before.
Second picture was taken during our trip along the Côte d&amp;rsquo;Azur.

The scenery from the first picture was so colorful, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with how the result turned out.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 7 The first image was taken at the Caserme Della Bandia. It was very interesting to explore these ruins perched so high in the mountains.
Second and third pictures were shot during our visit of the Vallée de Névache: one of the most beautiful valley we took during this journey.

      <description>Alpinaraid 6 The two pictures from this set are also among my favourites. They were taken at the Colle di Sommeiller, at 3000 m altitude. We were enjoying the landscape after going uphill about 800 m of positive elevation. Notice how the hood is a bit open: we called it the &amp;lsquo;race mode&amp;rsquo;, the goal was to cool-off the engine bay a bit faster.

      <description>Alpinaraid 5 The first picture in this set is my favourite from the whole journey. I was lucky enough to take out the camera before the cloud could go further away, and managed to shoot it with the sunset hitting the grass in the foreground. It was taken at the Rifugio dell&amp;rsquo;Assietta.
The second and third images were probably taken during cool-off breaks for the car, after long uphill roads (as seen in the background of image #3).</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 4 The two pictures were taken on the shore of Lago Di Rochemolles, on our way to the Colle Di Sommeiller.

Focusing is a bit tricky with the Rollei, as it is made with a ring around the lens, according to a value the photographer has to measure (in my case, it was measured with stride length).</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 2 Here are the first pictures I took of our Genesis Blue Peugeot 205.
The first image was shot at the Lac du Mont-Cenis. It really looks like we were all alone in this beautiful scenery.
Second picture was taken somewhere in Italy, during a mountain pass downhill.
Last photo was taken at Col du Glandon (1924 m).

I think the use of the Superia Xtra roll was a great choice for its pastel looking feel in the blue and green range.</description>
