      <description>Abandonned convent A small convent in the alsacian wineyards. Besides a cat that scared us at the end, it was a very calm and relaxing visit. Lots of small empty rooms, a chapel, kitchen, interior garden.
Last picture was to finish the roll: we stumbled across some hang-gliders flying.
Photo details Second part of my BGC PHC-50 film roll. I think the blacks are really deep, and the 50 ISO + use of flash really made these look dramatic.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 10 This last set from the Alpinaraid series regroup all pictures I took during our trip to come back home. We drove by the Gorges du Verdon, which is where I took the different pictures.
It is a beautiful, natural place, that was unfortunately a bit dry when we were there.

      <description>Abandonned hotel in the mountains Second part of the &amp;lsquo;abandonned hotel in the moutain&amp;rsquo; series: a hotel on top of the mountains, built in the 1920s and closed since 1994.
Inside: a pool, dancefloor, kitchen, rooms, and more. There is a second building which unfortunately burnt down.
The place is quite well known from exploration enjoyers, hence some artists beautifully decorated some of the rooms.
The first picture shows a graffiti of a masked man The second picture depicts a fully decorated room with music scores, pins, and typewritten letters.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 9 Finish line! The first image was taken at the Menton Beach, where we finished the Alpinaraid. It was an amazing experience, I saw places, sceneries and landscapes that I have never seen before.
Second picture was taken during our trip along the Côte d&amp;rsquo;Azur.

      <description>Alpinaraid 8 In this set, I chose three images I took during our stroll in Saint-Véran (one of Europe&amp;rsquo;s most elevated village). It it a peaceful village we enjoyed discovering.
The last image of this set was shot during a downhill in Italy. Cows were on the other side of the lake.

      <description>Alpinaraid 7 The first image was taken at the Caserme Della Bandia. It was very interesting to explore these ruins perched so high in the mountains.
Second and third pictures were shot during our visit of the Vallée de Névache: one of the most beautiful valley we took during this journey.

      <description>Alpinaraid 6 The two pictures from this set are also among my favourites. They were taken at the Colle di Sommeiller, at 3000 m altitude. We were enjoying the landscape after going uphill about 800 m of positive elevation. Notice how the hood is a bit open: we called it the &amp;lsquo;race mode&amp;rsquo;, the goal was to cool-off the engine bay a bit faster.

      <description>Alpinaraid 5 The first picture in this set is my favourite from the whole journey. I was lucky enough to take out the camera before the cloud could go further away, and managed to shoot it with the sunset hitting the grass in the foreground. It was taken at the Rifugio dell&amp;rsquo;Assietta.
The second and third images were probably taken during cool-off breaks for the car, after long uphill roads (as seen in the background of image #3).</description>

Second picture is the exterior of the Amos Rex museum Fourth picture is the Kansallismuseo Fifth picture is the front of the Helsingin tuomiokirkko, the city&amp;rsquo;s Cathedral. Photo details This trip was the first time I used the Rollei 35S, which was perfectly adapted to travel due to its pocket form factor.</description>

Photo details Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra
Focusing is a bit tricky with the Rollei, as it is made with a ring around the lens, according to a value the photographer has to measure (in my case, it was measured with stride length).</description>

Photo details For these pictures, I had to play with the focus ring on the Rollei 35S, to get the focus on objects not in the infinite range. It is a bit imprecise, but some pictures turned out great.

      <description>Alpinaraid 3 In this set, I decided to show various landscapes taken during the journey.
The first image is one of my favourite from the two rolls I shot during the adventure. It was 5 minutes before we ended surronded by the clouds seen in the background, at the Colle delle Finestre (2176 m).
Second image was taken during an uphill in an old italian military track.
Third one was shot in the morning at Camping Le Gravelotte, just after our first camp night.</description>

Second picture is the Finnish Parliament (Eduskusta) Third picture depicts the Vesikko submarine, it was taken on the island of Suomenlinna Photo details I had to edit the plane wing picture to remove some stains and noises, which I normally don&amp;rsquo;t do because they are part of the picture when doing film photography. But since they were quite large, I had to work around to make it viewable.</description>

      <description>Alpinaraid 2 Here are the first pictures I took of our Genesis Blue Peugeot 205.
The first image was shot at the Lac du Mont-Cenis. It really looks like we were all alone in this beautiful scenery.
Second picture was taken somewhere in Italy, during a mountain pass downhill.
Last photo was taken at Col du Glandon (1924 m).

I think the use of the Superia Xtra roll was a great choice for its pastel looking feel in the blue and green range.</description>

In this first set Alpinaraid 1, photos 1 and 2 were taken on the border of the Annecy Lake, in the early morning, on our way to the starting point at Col de la Madeleine (2000 m).</description>
