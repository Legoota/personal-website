## Blackjack Reaper v1

Reaper v1 is my all time favourite sculpt. It was made by Brocaps.

Here, in my favourite colorway, Blackjack (black hood has some glitter dust, and eyes are red foiled).

Fun fact: I had the chance to acquire this cap as my first Reaper (now I own around 30 of them). I traded it two years later. Missed it instantly, so I tried hard to get it back.

Found another one for trade so I got one back. Still, it wasn't my original one. Fast forward one year later, the person I traded it to decided to sell it, so I had the chance to buy it again.

At that point, I had two of them, so I traded the second one I got for another great Reaper v1 colorway.
