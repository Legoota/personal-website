## TGR Alice Prototype

One of the early prototypes made by Yuktsi from TGR, before the official run of the TGR Alice keyboard.

This is the board that started the trend of Alice-like layouts.

It is built with lubed vintage Cherry MX Browns, and the keyset used is ePBT's Purple Hangul.

### Artisans

Quantum Creep Typebeast from GAF and Dire Wire Moondrop from Nightcaps.
