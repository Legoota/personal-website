## Abandonned hotel in the mountains

First part of the 'abandonned hotel in the moutain' series: a hotel on top of the mountains, built in the 1920s and closed since 1994.

Inside: a pool, dancefloor, kitchen, rooms, and more. There is a second building which unfortunately burnt down (last picture).

### Photo details

First part of my BGC PHC-50 film roll. The Yashica ZoomTec 90 did a great job getting shots of this piece of history atop of the mountains.

Its portable form factor and its sturdiness were a plus for this kind of visit.

The roll used (BGC PHC-50) was a great choice considering the low light inside the buildings. The integrated flash from the camera was used for almost all my interior shots.
