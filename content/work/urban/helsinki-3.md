## Helsinki 3

Last series of pictures from my Helsinki trip. Some other great pieces of architecture:
 - Second picture is the Finnish Parliament (*Eduskusta*)
 - Third picture depicts the *Vesikko* submarine, it was taken on the island of *Suomenlinna*

### Photo details

I had to edit the plane wing picture to remove some stains and noises, which I normally don't do because they are part of the picture when doing film photography. But since they were quite large, I had to work around to make it viewable.

Rollei 35S + Kodak Tri-X 400.
