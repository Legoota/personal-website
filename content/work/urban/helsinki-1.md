## Helsinki 1

First series of pictures from my Helsinki trip. I tried to capture there the city's architecture.
There are some notable buildings:
 - Second picture is the exterior of the Amos Rex museum
 - Fourth picture is the *Kansallismuseo*
 - Fifth picture is the front of the *Helsingin tuomiokirkko*, the city's Cathedral.
 
### Photo details

This trip was the first time I used the Rollei 35S, which was perfectly adapted to travel due to its pocket form factor.
I found the images really sharp, the Sonnar lens is impressive. The fact that it is a prime lens forced me to move around the structures I wanted to shoot to get the angles correctly.

The film used was a Kodak Tri-X 400, which gave this singular grain over the pictures, even on white buildings on a cloudy sky in the fourth image.
