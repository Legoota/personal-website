## Helsinki 2

Second series of pictures from my Helsinki trip. This time, it is consacred to the University's Botanical garden (*Kaisaniemen kasvitieteellinen puutarha*).

### Photo details

For these pictures, I had to play with the focus ring on the Rollei 35S, to get the focus on objects not in the infinite range. It is a bit imprecise, but some pictures turned out great.

Rollei 35S + Kodak Tri-X 400.
