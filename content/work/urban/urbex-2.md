## Abandonned hotel in the mountains

Second part of the 'abandonned hotel in the moutain' series: a hotel on top of the mountains, built in the 1920s and closed since 1994.

Inside: a pool, dancefloor, kitchen, rooms, and more. There is a second building which unfortunately burnt down.

The place is quite well known from exploration enjoyers, hence some artists beautifully decorated some of the rooms.

 * The first picture shows a graffiti of a masked man
 * The second picture depicts a fully decorated room with music scores, pins, and typewritten letters. There was a red rope going from the entrance of the building up to this room, which was very enjoyable following to discover this little exhibit.

### Photo details

First part of my BGC PHC-50 film roll. The Yashica ZoomTec 90 did a great job getting shots of this piece of history atop of the mountains.

Its portable form factor and its sturdiness were a plus for this kind of visit.

The roll used (BGC PHC-50) was a great choice considering the low light inside the buildings. The integrated flash from the camera was used for almost all my interior shots.
