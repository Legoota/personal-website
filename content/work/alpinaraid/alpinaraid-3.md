## Alpinaraid 3

In this set, I decided to show various landscapes taken during the journey.

The first image is one of my favourite from the two rolls I shot during the adventure. It was 5 minutes before we ended surronded by the clouds seen in the background, at the Colle delle Finestre (2176 m).

Second image was taken during an uphill in an old italian military track.

Third one was shot in the morning at Camping Le Gravelotte, just after our first camp night.<br/>
Fun fact: This website's homepage background image was shot right after the one you see here: I discovered that I could have cable cars going down and up at the same time in one picture.

Last image was taken at Lago Nero during the third day of the adventure.

### Photo details

Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra

I'm very happy with how the first picture turned out. The blur of the weeds in the foreground is quite nice in my opinion.

I had to color correct a bit the last image as it turned out a bit too purpleish. It happened to some pictures of the end of my first roll for an unknown reason.
