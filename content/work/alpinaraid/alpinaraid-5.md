## Alpinaraid 5

The first picture in this set is my favourite from the whole journey. I was lucky enough to take out the camera before the cloud could go further away, and managed to shoot it with the sunset hitting the grass in the foreground.<br/>
It was taken at the <i>Rifugio dell'Assietta</i>.

The second and third images were probably taken during cool-off breaks for the car, after long uphill roads (as seen in the background of image #3).

### Photo details

Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra

As I already mentionned, I find this lens' bokeh very pleasing to the eye, so I'm happy that I decided to shoot things with out-of-focus elements even if that meant possibly missing the focus on the subject.
