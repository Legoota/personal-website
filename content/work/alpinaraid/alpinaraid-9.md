## Alpinaraid 9

Finish line! The first image was taken at the <i>Menton Beach</i>, where we finished the Alpinaraid.<br/>
It was an amazing experience, I saw places, sceneries and landscapes that I have never seen before.

Second picture was taken during our trip along the <i>CÃ´te d'Azur</i>.

### Photo details

Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra

The scenery from the first picture was so colorful, I couldn't be happier with how the result turned out.

However, the second picture was too audacious from someone who has trembling hands. Moreover, I tried to shoot it standing still without a tripod. It could have resulted in a great picture.
