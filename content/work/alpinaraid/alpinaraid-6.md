## Alpinaraid 6

The two pictures from this set are also among my favourites. They were taken at the <i>Colle di Sommeiller</i>, at 3000 m altitude. We were enjoying the landscape after going uphill about 800 m of positive elevation.<br/>
Notice how the hood is a bit open: we called it the '<i>race mode</i>', the goal was to cool-off the engine bay a bit faster.

### Photo details

Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra

For these two images, I used a short exposure as the goal was to capture the splashes from driving in the water, so I had to open wide. The result came out a lot better than expected, and I am grateful that we were able to keep a physical memory of this moment.
