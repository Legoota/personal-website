## Alpinaraid 8

In this set, I chose three images I took during our stroll in <i>Saint-VÃ©ran</i> (one of Europe's most elevated village). It it a peaceful village we enjoyed discovering.

The last image of this set was shot during a downhill in Italy. Cows were on the other side of the lake.

### Photo details

Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra

I really like how the water turns out with this roll of film. It looks almost cyan, but the real color was not far away from that.
