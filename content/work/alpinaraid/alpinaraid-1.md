## Alpinaraid 1

This is it. After months of preparation of our Peugeot 205, we finally started our journey into the French and Italian Alps.

In this 10 set series, you can find the film photographies that I took during the whole adventure.

In this first set <i>Alpinaraid 1</i>, photos 1 and 2 were taken on the border of the Annecy Lake, in the early morning, on our way to the starting point at Col de la Madeleine (2000 m). The third photo was taken during the first day of the journey. I think it was the first glacier that we could see so well.

### Photo details

Before July 2022, I was still indecisive whether to coose the Rollei 35S or the Yashica ZoomTec 90 for this trip.

I got the scans from the roll I took during my Helsinki trip using the Rollei, and it convinced me to take this small point and shoot with me for the journey.

As far as film roll was concerned, I wanted to shoot a color film, and decided to use the Fujifilm Superia Xtra 400.
