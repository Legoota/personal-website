## Alpinaraid 2

Here are the first pictures I took of our <i>Genesis Blue</i> Peugeot 205.

The first image was shot at the <i>Lac du Mont-Cenis</i>. It really looks like we were all alone in this beautiful scenery.

Second picture was taken somewhere in Italy, during a mountain pass downhill.

Last photo was taken at <i>Col du Glandon</i> (1924 m).

### Photo details

Rollei 35S + Fujifilm Superia Xtra

I think the use of the Superia Xtra roll was a great choice for its pastel looking feel in the blue and green range. The car really stands out when taken in a green / gray background.
